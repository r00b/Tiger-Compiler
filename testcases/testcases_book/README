Stage: parser

Team member: Robert Steilberg and Tai-Lin Wu

Implementation Details:

Our code is a specification for ML-YACC to build a Tiger parser using a lexer created by ML-LEX.

1. LET: For `let` clauses, we take care of mutual recursion of `FunctionDec` and `TypeDec`
with groupDecs function. For `VarDec`, we create an extra non-terminal, 
`expExceptNil`, to prevent a variable of record type is declared with value `NIL`.
